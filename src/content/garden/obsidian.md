[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note-taking tool.
Notes created in Obsidian use the [Markdown](markdown) format.
The Obsidian way of note-taking stimulates to link notes together
and keep notes [atomic](atomic) (a single topic/concept per note).
The default way to link between notes is using [wikilinks](wikilink).
It is also possible to configure Obsidian to use regular Markdown links.

Obsidian has a graph view that shows all notes and the connections between them.
The graph view can be used to overview notes,
and see the coherence of the notes in a single view.
The graph view shows non-existing notes in a light-gray color.

The Obsidian community maintains a large collection of plugins that
enhance Obsidian. This is done by new syntax in the Markdown files.
The downside of plugins is that it defeats the
portability aspect of Obsidian because the Markdown files become
littered with unofficial Markdown.

A project in Obsidian is called a vault. A vault is just a directory
inside a file system. Obsidian stores all its data in the hidden
`.obsidian/` directory.
