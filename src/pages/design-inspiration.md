I got inspired by aspects of the following websites:  

## A minimalistic approach

* [mnmlist.com](https://mnmlist.com/)
* [The Small Web](https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/)

## Color scheme

The website has a very minimalistic black and white [color palette](/colors).
The only color on the website is found in code blocks. Other websites that use
a black and white [color scheme](/notes/color-scheme) are:

* [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/)
* [Mozilla Protocol](https://protocol.mozilla.org/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Breadcrumb navigation

* [mellow.dev](https://mellow.dev/)

## Link styling on hover
Since my website uses a black and white color scheme, I found the default
blue text color for `<a>` links didn't match the design. To make links stand
out, I added external link icons and underlined the link text. Additionally,
I inverted the text and background colors on hover. I was inspired to use this
color inversion technique by [Bradwoods garden](https://garden.bradwoods.io/).
