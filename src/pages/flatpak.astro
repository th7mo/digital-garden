  Some proprietary applications or applications are not provided by the Debian repository.
  In those cases it could be better to install the Flatpak packaged version of that application.
  Steam and Parsec are examples of applications that are ugly to install on Debian and
  should be isolated using Flatpak.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The Debian package for Flatpak is <code>flatpak</code>. Install Flatpak with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sudo apt install flatpak</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
  Refer to the <a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak website</a> for how to install applications using Flatpak.
</p>

<h2>Make application launchers find Flatpak applications</h2>
<p>
  When the Flatpak applications are installed, most application launchers are not able to find them.
  This is because the Flatpak applications are not in a directory listed in the
  <a href="path-.html"><code>$PATH</code> variable</a>.
  To make those application launchers find the Flatpak applications,
  it is possible to create a <a href="symbolic-link.html">symbolic link</a> to 
  the <code>/usr/bin/</code> directory (or any other directory included in the
  <code>$PATH</code> variable)<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.
</p>
<pre><code is:raw class="lang-sh">ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/{installed-flatpak-name} /usr/bin/{custom-name}</code></pre>
<p> For example for Steam:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin/com.valvesoftware.Steam /usr/bin/steam</code></pre>
<p>
  Now application launchers (and the terminal) are able to find the Flatpak application,
  because it is added to the <code>$PATH</code> variable.
