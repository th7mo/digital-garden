  <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a version control system.
  It is used for the <a href="digital-garden">digital garden</a> to keep track of changes and preserve history.
  It also allows for accessible collaboration.

<!-- TODO:
This note is not complete yet.
The Git workflow (branch strategy) can have a better explanation.

The terms used in the worktree section is inconsistent, and there should be a warning about only executing commands in the bare workspace `{repository-name}/.git/`

There is also a way to do not rely on GNU Stow but use a bare repository to manage dotfiles.
This needs to be researched first.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install Git by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sudo apt install git</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>All the configuration for Git is stored in <a href="gitconfig.html">gitconfig</a> files.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
  A <a href="commit.html">commit</a> creates a snapshot of the current state of a Git repository.
  Git uses <a href="branch.html">branches</a> for collaborate work and diverging from the default environment.
</p>

<h2>Pull request / Merge request</h2>
<p>The <a href="rebase.html">rebase</a> strategy is also a good option for pull requests.</p>
<p>
  Do not squash commits or merge a pull request using the <a href="squash.html">squash</a> strategy,
  unless the commit messages are not providing any useful information.
  It is always better to leave as much history as possible for later debugging of code.
</p>

<h2>Worktrees</h2>
<p>
  <a href="worktree.html">Worktrees</a> can be used to switch between branches
  without committing or stashing changes. 
</p>

<h2>Multiple Git identities</h2>
<p>
  See <a href="multiple-identities.html">multiple git identities</a>
  for how to configure multiple Git identities.
