[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a note-taking tool. Notes created in
Obsidian use the [Markdown](markdown) format. The Obsidian way of
note-taking stimulates to link notes together and keep notes atomic (a
single topic/concept per note). This can be done with wiki links or
regular Markdown links.

Obsidian has a graph view that shows all notes and how to are related to
each other. The graph view can be used to overview notes, and see the
coherence in a single view. The graph view stimulates linking notes
together.

The Obsidian community maintains a large collection of plugins that
enhance Obsidian. The downside of plugins is that it defeats the
portability aspect of Obsidian.

A project in Obsidian is called a vault. A vault is just a directory
inside a file system. Obsidian stores all its data in the hidden
`.obsidian` directory.
