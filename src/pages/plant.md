The [digital garden](digital-garden.html) is composed of plants. A plant
represents a *single* idea, and should be split up if it contains more.
This makes plants [atomic](atomic). Plants can [link](link.html) to
other plants.

Plants undergo three phases of maturity:

-   *seedlings* are very rough and new ideas.
-   *buddings* are clarified and stable ideas.
-   *evergreens* are completed and established ideas.

Although evergreens are \'completed\', plants always require some
pruning now and then. No plant is ever completely finished and always
grows.

A plant\'s current phase of maturity is indicated with an icon at the
navigation on top of the page.

## Naming

Ideally, a name for a plant should be one word. This will mostly prevent
the heading 1 to span multiple lines on mobile devices. If a name could
represent multiple things, a disambiguation qualifier surrounded by `(`
parentheses `)` must be added.

For example, Mercury can refer to a chemical element and a planet. To
distinguish the two, they can be named `Mercury (element)` and
`Mercury (planet)`.
