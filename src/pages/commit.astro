<Layout title="Commit" maturity="budding">
<p>
  A commit is a snapshot of a <a href="git.html">Git</a> repository.
  Commits should be short, ideally representing an <a href="atomic.html">atomic</a> change.
</p>

<h2>Commit message</h2>
<p>
  A commit message can have a short summary, and an optional longer explanation after an empty line.
  Do not use emoji's in commit messages like
  <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/">the gitmoji project</a> tries to achieve. 
  Emojis do not provide any benefit to the commit message.
  There are still a lot of tools that lack proper emoji support.
  It is also way more difficult to filter or search commit messages when they use emojis for categorizing commits.
</p>
<p>Use the following prefixes for commit message titles:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>feat:</code> for new functionality.</li>
  <li><code>fix:</code> for reworking existing code to solve bugs.</li>
  <li><code>refact:</code> for refactoring code.</li>
  <li><code>docs:</code> for adding documentation.</li>
  <li><code>test:</code> for adding or fixing tests.</li>
  <li><code>bump:</code> for incrementing version numbers of dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A good convention to use is <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">conventional commits</a>.
  The <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint">commitlint project</a>
  expands on this and adds more categories.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to not introduce to many prefix categories.
  This will defeat the purpose if categorizing commits.
</p>

<h2>Undo commits</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes it is desired to undo changes made by one or multiple commits.
  Prefer <a href="revert.html">reverting</a> over <a href="reset.html">resetting</a> commits
  to preserve the git history.
</p>
